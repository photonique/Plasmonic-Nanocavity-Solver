                        Author: Muthiah Annamalai

Solver:
=======
This package contains code for calculating the electric field in surface of
a 1D Silver thinfilm nanocavity on Silicon substrate and further propagating
this nearfield to a farfield. Solvers further compute the farfield radiation
pattern of this nanocavity, and its coupling to a TEM00 Gaussian mode.

Typically these nanophotonic devices based on Plasmon propagation in sub-wavelength nanocavities offer oppotunities for Purcell-effect driven single photon
emitters, and mode shaping for efficient farfield radiation collections.

Further this package offers nonlinear discrete search methods using Genetic Algorithms and Particle-Swarm-Optimizations for efficient search of geometries with
suitable properties for devices providing resonance and transmission at different
wavelengths simulatenously. Such devices maybe useful in nonlinear optics applications.
